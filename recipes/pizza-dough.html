            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Get the party started with this quick and easy pizza dough.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
                <li>350g strong white bread flour</li>
                <li>1 sachet fast-action dried yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp caster sugar</li>
                <li>pizza toppings of your choice</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="recipe-steps">
                <li>Tip the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and sugar. Make a well in the middle, tip in 200ml warm water and a large pinch of salt, and mix using a wooden spoon until all the flour has been incorporated and you have a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Tip into a bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and set aside to rest for 5 mins. (You can leave the dough to rise further if you have time, but it’s not required for a thin crust.)</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put a pizza stone, sturdy baking sheet or upturned baking tray on the top shelf of the oven to heat up. If you’ve left the dough to rise, knock it back, then divide into two balls. Roll one of the balls out on a floured surface into a large circle using a rolling pin, then lift onto a floured baking sheet. Scatter over the toppings of your choice, then carefully slide the pizza from the baking sheet straight onto the hot stone, sheet or tray in the oven. Bake for 8-10 mins until the topping is bubbling and the base is crisp. Remove from the oven and repeat with the second ball of dough.</li>
